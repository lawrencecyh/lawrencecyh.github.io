前陣子不知道哪根筋不對約了3/9做年度健檢，結果搞得生日當天晚上得禁食。真是有點莫名其妙<br>
不過不論如何，我又平安的老一歲了，謝謝大家 :)

I don't know what got into me, but I happened to schedule my annual physical exam to be in the morning of 3/9. As a result, I had to fast on the night of my birthday. Tough luck.<br>
But on the bright side, I just grew another year older. Thanks for the birthday wishes :)

**"Promise me, Dad"**

最近看了美國前副總統拜登的回紀錄。這本書沒有中文版，不過內容大致是紀錄2014至2015年，他大兒子Beau於因腦癌過世前一年中所發生的事。Beau Biden過世時年僅四十六歲，卻已經擁有相當高的政治聲望。他甚至被許多人看好未來能代表民主黨參選美國總統。在這一年之間，老拜登因為職責時常在外奔波，卻又得時時掛念愛子的醫療進度。就算平日一人之下萬人之上，呼風喚雨處理各種美國外交難題，碰到生命的脆弱也還是得聽天由命。

其中最令我印象深刻的一段故事，就是他與一位中國移民劉偉棠的互動。劉先生的兒子劉文健是一名紐約市警官，卻於2014年遭到槍殺殉職。拜登前往喪禮致意時，劉偉棠因為英文不好，只能抱著副總統不斷道謝。不到一年後，拜登在自己兒子的喪禮上，認出特地趕來的劉偉棠。這次，換成拜登不停說謝謝。他們依舊語言不通，但當兩人再次擁抱的時候，卻瞬間能完全體會對方當時的感受。

拜登在很多方面都讓我想到高中時充滿崇高理想的自己。這幾年的我變得務實很多，不過我的人生觀還是跟他非常相似。尤其是爲人處世時，我們往往都會選擇從人性的角度出發。我相信人性終究是自私的，而自私並沒有善惡之分。想在社會上有所貢獻，就一定得好好利用這點。設身處地了解人家在想些什麼、感受什麼、為什麼而努力，才能化解紛爭共同解決一些最重要的問題。而在此同時，你與這些人建構的鏈結，日後也將定義你的思想、記憶、甚至是歷史定位。

Recently, I had the chance to read former US vice president Joe Biden's memoir, "Promise me, Dad." It chronicles the time around 2014 and 2015, when his eldest son, Beau, spent the last year of his life fighting brain cancer. Beau Biden was Delaware's attorney general, a rising star in politics, and considered by many to have a chance at running for president some day. He was only 46. Joe Biden, the second-most powerful man in the country who affects the lives of millions through his socioeconomic and foreign policy decisions, still had absolutely no power to protect his own son against the relentlessness of death.

I was especially touched by his story about a man named Wei Tang Liu. Mr. Liu is the father of Wenjian Liu, an officer in the New York Police Department who was fatally shot while on duty in 2014. Liu barely spoke English, so when Biden showed up at Wenjian's funeral, he could only hold on to the vice president and keep saying his thanks. Less than a year later, Biden would recognize Mr. Liu who also showed up at Beau's funeral to pay respects. They still could not communicate to each other, but as the two men embraced once more, no words were needed to convey their exact feelings.

In many ways, Joe Biden reminds me of my high school self that was full of ideals. I have become much more pragmatic these years, but the human-centric approach I use in life has remained very similar to his. I believe that individuals are fundamentally selfish, and selfishness is not a vice nor virtue. To make an impact in the world, one has to take advantage of this fact. Only by standing in other people's shoes and seeing the world through their eyes can you reconcile differences and solve the most important problems together. Some day, the social links constructed in this process will also come to define your thoughts, memories, and even legacy.

**Taipei**

再談談宏達電跟台北好了。Google在2017年九月以11億美元買下宏達電的智慧手機部門以及智慧財產的非限定授權，約兩千名員工轉職為正式Google成員。這樁交易在2018年一月底正式結案，所以我就跟著團隊裡的幾個人飛去台北幫忙。整體而言覺得宏達電公司環境不錯、優秀的人不少、產品本身也算有水準。比起幾年前的盛況，會變成這樣實在蠻奇怪也蠻可惜的。不過話說回來，科技業本來就少有永遠的贏家或輸家，或許現在講這些都還太早吧？

出差最讓我開心的是，因為自己多請了幾天假，所以終於有一年能回家過年領紅包了！初三剛到台北的時候什麼店都沒開是有點無聊，不過陪著家人瞎混打麻將的日子畢竟也沒什麼可以抱怨的。想想上次年假期間在台北已經是2010的事情，而且這次回去竟然是因工作之緣，只能說世事難料啊。

Let's talk about HTC and Taipei. Last September, Google acquired parts of HTC's smartphone division as well as non-exclusive rights to all intellectual property. As a result, approximately two thousand employees joined Google full time. The deal officially closed late January 2018, so I had the chance to fly to Taipei with a few colleagues to help out with the transition. Overall I really liked the environment at HTC, and they certainly have many talented people that helped shipped solid products. It is truly regretful that the company barely resembles the empire it once was, but I suppose it's too early to say these things right now. After all, this is the tech world where there are few permanent winners or losers.

The thing that I loved most about this trip was definitely taking a few extra days off to enjoy the Chinese New Year. Most businesses were closed in the first few days, but there is little to complain about spending some quality time with family during the holidays. The last time I had the chance to do so was in 2010, and it really is a twist of fate that I am able to go home this year. Who would've guessed this would be possible?

**Future**

幾個月來跟許多人聊過工作以及人生規劃，又讓我萌生回去讀書的想法。總覺得要趁這幾年再挑戰一下自己、逼自己多學點東西。不但是為了興趣，也是為了打開未來的一扇窗。不過，由於現在的工作又有點讓我放不下，所以暫時應該會往在職進修碩士學位的方向去努力。一切順利的話，2019年就可以再次成為學生了。對次有經驗的人麻煩請多多跟我分享XD

I chatted with many people over the last few months about work and career planning. The idea of going back to school has grown a little on me, and I want to push myself to learn some more and open some doors in the future. However, since I still love my job and find it hard to leave it completely, I'll probably end up doing some sort of part-time MS degree. If all goes well, I'll become a student again in the fall of 2019. Please do share any related experiences if you have any!
