Happy New Year!

Yes, it has been a while. The past few months have been a frenzy, and I truly regret not being able to document everything in a timely manner. In short, 2017 was the year of growing up, and I have reasons to think 2018 will be defined by how well I can take advantage of new opportunities.

Grandfather passed away in November.

I still remember getting the phone call over lunch one day, informing me that after spending three weeks in the hospital, his condition had started to deteriorate. Gregory and I booked flights in a frenzy and landed in Taipei less than 24 hours later, and luckily we did. Grandfather was still able to recognize us at the time, but he slipped out of consciousness the same night and passed away three days later with all of us by his side.

Such is an inevitable part of our lives, but it really is impossible to adequately prepare oneself for it. I have largely overcome the fear of death itself, but the fear of _dying_ is a different matter entirely. Those few days in the hospital were by far the toughest I've ever had to deal with. There was so much uncertainty, and we constantly had to grapple with decisions of whether to sign the DNR or perform increasingly invasive but likely futile medical procedures. And yet, it is these difficult times that really bring the family together. We learned how to be vulnerable in front of each other, and also how to be strong when we needed to.

I did the best we could, and now that everything is said and done, I am ready to move on. Grandfather lived a fulfilling life with little to regret, and I will strive to do the same.

Like Joe Biden, I found returning work to be my salvation. It gave me something to think about and a purpose to work towards. I have said this time and time, but it truly is a blessing to have a job doing something I love from the bottom of my heart.

Earlier this year, the team shipped Pixel 2 and 2 XL after months of hard work. It naturally wasn't as exciting as the first time, but overall I am again very pleased with what we were able to bring to the table. Now with two full product cycles under my belt, I have slowly begun to take on responsibilities such as project planning and mentoring. In November, I also officially earned the title of tech lead, which will eventually mean more meetings and probably less programming. Instead of doing all of the work myself, I am now thinking more about how to make the team happier and more productive. The mentality is quite different, but my gut feeling is that the underlying skill requirements are largely the same.

On a similar note, we recently expanded to San Diego and now have a sub-team of three people there permanently. Along with the pending [HTC acquisition][htc], there will surely be significant restructuring of the team as well as changes to how we collaborate. With change comes new opportunities, and I have a feeling that my next few years will be heavily influenced by the choices I make in the upcoming months. These choices will be as much about lifestyle as they will be about my career itself, so now is a good time as any to think about the things and people that matter to me the most.

With the next big projects coming right around the corner, things will undoubtedly start to get hectic again soon. 2018 is shaping to be another interesting one, and hopefully we'll continue to deliver surprises and delightful memories to our customers.

I plan on adding a few more supporting features to Parallax this year. This includes a mailing list for new content, a better consumption medium for my photos, and a search/indexing system for posts. I have yet to decide how to implement any of this, so suggestions are welcome. I wouldn't be opposed to the idea of leveraging social media either. After that's done, I hope to start writing on a cadence and publish at least once a month on average.

Anyhow, that's enough rambling for now. While you're here, please enjoy some photos I took on my recent weekend excursion to Lake Tahoe. Next stop will be Vancouver in early February, and hopefully Taipei soon if circumstances allow.
