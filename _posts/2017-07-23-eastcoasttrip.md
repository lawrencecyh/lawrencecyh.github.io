It looks like we are way overdue for an update. Time really flies when you're working hard to make the next release of Android not suck, doesn't it?

Anyhow, to make up for the hiatus, I'm back at it to entertain you with some highlights of my recent east coast excursion. Enjoy!

The stated reason for this trip was to go to Toronto for a Muse concert (and food. It's always about food.) But then we figured since we're already flying all the way there, might as well include a couple more cities just because why not. And so plane tickets were booked and I hopped on a red-eye flight to Toronto.

***July 14-15, 2017***

By noon the day I arrived, it became apparent I also brought with me some blissful California weather, as shown by this shot of Toronto Island from my brother's apartment:

Vanessa and Evelyn arrived three hours later than planned due to delays at EWR, so after picking them up we headed straight to dinner. Our pick for the night was [Edulis][Edulis], an upscale but cozy restaurant with a focus on seafood and vegetables. At 85 CAD for the 7-course tasting menu, the experience was sensational and beyond worth it. On the left is a photo of the salmon course, accompanied by the most perfectly-prepared beans I have ever had:

The following day was travel day. We had a very loose schedule, and was able to make a detour to the small town of Wellington and visit the famous [Drake Devonshire][Drake]. With great food and impeccable views of Lake Ontario, all of us agreed that with the provincial and national parks nearby, this tiny hotel is undoubtedly worth a repeat visit. Above right: lunch at Drake. Below: the girls enjoying a view of Lake Ontario from the restaurant's private beach.

We didn't arrive at Montreal until almost 7 due to miscalculations and an Evelyn detour (aka beer stop), but still made it to our dinner appointment with plenty of time to spare. Soup, anyone?

***July 16, 2017***

This was our only full day on Montreal, so we made sure to fully take advantage of it. Gregory is the only one who's been to Montreal before (and only once), so we decided to visit some of the typical touristy places: Old Port, Museum of Archeology and History, Atwater Market, McGill University, and Mount Royal. Overall, I find Montreal to be an extremely amicable city that, in many ways, sits at the crossroads of two worlds. The city takes immense pride in its historical heritage, but does not lack any modern conveniences. Narrow streets sprawl messily across the map yet somehow manage to be impeccably clean and well-kept. Century-old buildings emanates with youthfulness in a way that reminds me of Boston, but with a hint of familiarity that makes it feel like home.

Between the 6-glass wine pairing over dinner and a bar trip afterwards, I think I consumed a surprising amount of alcohol for someone who doesn't even drink regularly. Cheers to the Montreal nightlife :D

***July 17-18, 2017***

Drove back to Toronto while stopping by Sandbanks Provincial Park and Drake again on the way back. We then goofed around for a day until the Muse concert at night. Let's just say that Matt Bellamy is even better live than he is in recordings. The showboating certainly doesn't hurt either.

I now move on to the final leg of my trip -- New York. The remaining details are best organized by category, so that is what I'll do.

***Fine Dining***

After landing, Vanessa and I make our way to [Sushi Nakazawa][Nakazawa], the famous sushi bar hidden in West Village. The food was good but not particularly memorable, although I did enjoy the live botan-ebi (albeit the excessive finger lime on top). We both agreed the rice had a slight taste to it that interfered with the fish a little, but couldn't pinpoint what it was other than a hint of saltiness. What irritated me more, however, was the pretentious black/white decor and waiting staff dressed in suits. Compared to many other great and welcoming sushi bars that I've been to, the ambiance in Nakazawa just feels too uptight and arrogant for me to fully appreciate a relaxing meal.

On the other hand, our trip the following day to the three-star French restaurant [Le Bernardin][Bernardin] was much more impressive. This seafood-specializing spot had a lovely dining room and great selection of courses to satisfy anyone's appetite. We went with the four-course, prix-fixe menu that comes with your choice of three courses and a dessert.  Being a shameless shellfish addict, I ended up going with geoduck sashimi, seared langoustine, baked lobster, and homemade sorbet. I had high hopes for the Scotland-imported langoustine, but it was the geoduck with ginger-ponzu dressing that really made my day. T'was good food and good company -- what else could one ask for?

***Google NYC***

Since I decided to work remotely from Google's NYC office at [111 Eighth Avenue][GoogleBuilding] for two days, I figured I might as well spend some time exploring the little surprises it has to offer. The first gem was this library on the fifth floor with some innocuous-looking bookshelves:

Except they could rotate to reveal the secret nap rooms inside, just because why not?

Next up, somebody thought it was a good idea to take out parts of the floors and make an atrium between the eighth and eleventh floors. Looks pretty good actually:

Then there's the 14th-floor balcony, overlooking the entire lower-Manhattan and parts of Jersey City. As a rule of thumb, pretty much every remote office is better than Mountain View HQ.

***The Great Comet***

The last memorable event was going to see the Broadway musical "The Great Comet". It was an interesting experience that I feel deserves its own article, so I shall revisit it at a later day. Feel free to hold me accountable for this promise :)

This concludes my brief account of the past week or so. In the meantime, looks like it's time to buckle down and get back to work. After all, we still have software to ship and the bugs aren't going to fix themselves.

Until next time!
