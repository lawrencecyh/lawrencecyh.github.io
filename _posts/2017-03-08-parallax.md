I turn 25 today. On this occasion, I am happy to announce the completion of my personal website, as well as my commitment to start writing regularly again. Thanks for the birthday wishes, and welcome to *Parallax*, my world of random musings and chaotic programming experiments.

今天是我二十五歲生日。利用這個機會，我很高興能跟大家分享我的新網站以及我定期寫作的決心。感謝大家的祝福，並歡迎來到*Parallax*這充斥著各種思辨以及程式實驗的世界。

The three years since graduation have passed in a flurry of excitement and product launches. As all this gradually becomes routine, it seems like days are now starting to blur together into an indistinguishable mess. As much as I enjoy the temperate lifestyle, I cannot help but wonder if I'll be able to accurately recount any of my current thoughts or experiences after a few years. And yet, it is these seemingly inconsequential and easily forgotten details that I happen to cherish the most.

With this in mind, I decided to resume writing after a lengthly hiatus. For those who do not know, back in high school and until some point in my college sophomore year, I kept a blog on [Wretch][wretch_en] (may it rest in peace). While it lasted, it was good place to distill meaningful conversations away from conventional social networking sites where the audience's attention span invariably converges to zero. Hopefully Parallax will be able to achieve the same effect and then some, while still giving me a canvas to explore some new web design approaches. Here are some examples of things you can expect in the upcoming weeks:

* Short accounts of recent trips, hopefully with pictures.
* Food. Probably lots of it.
* New stuff I learned, particularly in software engineering or science/tech.
* My opinions on recent news.
* Frequent UI changes and weird bugs. This is my web development hobby project after all.

And, to throw in an incentive for people to stop by more often:

* Sporadic reposts of old blog entries by my high school self. I even backed up comments!

Cheers!

畢業過後的時光隨著一個個產品發表會倏忽即逝，不知不覺就三年了（今年回去還被提醒今年的高一新生小我十屆）。在我慢慢適應這種步調之餘，才開始驚覺很多原本不相關的事件會慢慢混成一片無法離析的記憶。雖然很喜歡現在的生活安逸，但我有時不禁會懷疑，過了幾年之後我到底還有沒有辦法精確地敘述這段時間的想法及經歷？可是，這些看似平凡又容易忘記的小細節偏偏又是我最想珍藏的資產。

也就是因為有這種意識，我才決定重新開始寫網誌。有些人可能不知道，不過我在高中到大學期間曾經弄了個[無名小站][wretch_zh]（願它安息）。那段日子的無名提供了一個能夠認真溝通的平台，並遠離典型社群網站那種令閱聽人專注度無限趨近於零的環境。希望Parallax在讓我玩玩網頁設計之餘，也能達成跟舊網誌相同的沈澱效果。在接下來個日子中，你可以看到的可能包括：

* 儘量會附照片的簡短遊記。
* 大概會有很多食物。
* 新學到的東西。大多數應該會偏向軟體工程或科普類。
* 對於近期新聞的看法。
* 頻繁的使用者介面更新以及bug。這畢竟是我會拿來亂玩的小實驗嘛。

然後，為了提供各位讀者一些額外的樂趣：

* 不定期重貼以前無名的舊文章。我連留言都有備份喔！

慢用～
